# Ridge Computing Website

This is a Flask website made for [Ridge Computing](http://ridgecomputing.org), a nonprofit organization.

## Usage

Hmmâ€¦ install the dependencies from the Pipfile and Gemfile. Then run gunicorn, binding it to the 5000 port, I guess? Oh, yeah, you also gotta set up nginx, but that's trivial. You can Google that.

## Contributing

Uhh, just commit to some other branch and open a PR. I'll take a look and merge it if I like what I see.
